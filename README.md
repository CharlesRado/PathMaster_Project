## Article Collection ‚Äì External Scraper

The research articles featured in the app are **not manually added**. Instead, they are dynamically collected using a Python web scraper developed in a separate repository:

‚û° **[PathMaster Scraper (Python Repo)](https://github.com/CharlesRado/PathMaster_Scraper.git)**

This Python script scrapes data from four academic sources, structures it, and feeds it into **Firebase Firestore** using GitHub Actions. The mobile app retrieves this data in real time.
